				<p>For many people, blockchain technology is the new get rich quick scheme in town, with all manner of
					excitement about Bitcoin and other instances of what has come to be called cryptocurrency", along with its
					promise of instant electronic transactions and the notion of people acquiring hugely valuable cryptocurrency
					from nothing, as if by magic.</p>
				<p>Yet, unlike the typical scammer story, this one gets major press and legitimate levels of advertisement, all
					the while leaving the average person not really knowing what it is, but often curious as to financial
					opportunity. Money for nothing has always been an attractive idea, and it always will be. On this basis, many
					dishonest companies have come and gone, gathering large amounts of investment capital pursuant to their
					initial coin offering and then mysteriously disappearing, taking the investor capital with it.</p>
				<p>Verisium makes use of blockchain technology to create a means of statistically airtight product
					authentication, as well as the provision of additional features and services for the end-customer of a given
					name brand product that increases the levels of present and future continued customer engagement. However, we
					realize that the notion of blockchain technology suffers from the mythological fog that surrounds it.
					Therefore with a huge hat-tip to the writers at <a href="" target="_blank">www.datafloq.com</a>, we offer the
					description of a number
					of
					popular myths about blockchain technology and their debunking as they apply to what Verisium does with the
					technology.</p>

				<h2>The Myths of the Blockchain</h2>

				<h3>Myth 1: The Blockchain is a magical database in the cloud.</h3>
				<p>The Blockchain is conceptually a flat file – a linear list of simple transaction records. “This list is
					‘append’ only so entries are never deleted, but instead, the file grows indefinitely and must be replicated
					in every node in the peer-to-peer network” Blockchain doesn’t allow you to store any type of physical
					information like a Word document or a pdf file. It can only provide a proof-of-existence. The distributed
					ledger can only contain a code that certifies the existence of a certain document but not the document
					itself. The file, however, can be stored in “<b>data lakes</b>”, the access to which is controlled by the
					owner of
					the information.</p>

				<h3>Myth 2: Blockchain is going to change the world.</h3>
				<p>We can use Blockchain for complex and technical transactions – such as verifying the authenticity of a
					diamond or the identity of a person. There is also talk of a Blockchain application for the bill of lading in
					trade finance, which would be revolutionary in terms of cost reduction and transaction speed.</p>
				<p>The myth-buster goes on to say that "while Blockchain can support these cases and mitigate the risk of a
					fraudster tampering with the ledger, it does not eradicate the threat of fraud online and it still raises
					questions over confidentiality. Additionally, the use of Blockchain technology will still be inefficient for
					many of these cases when compared to maintaining a traditional ledger."</p>
				<p>However, this is a comment taken in the strictest of all senses - that there is no such thing as a
					completely secure computer or especially, network. That being said, we must further add here what other
					myth-busters did say about the security of the blockchain:</p>

				<div class="blog__article--alternative">
					<p>“The power of blockchain, of course, is that the code is public, transactions are verifiable, and the
						network is cryptographically secure. Fraudulent transactions— double spends, in industry parlance—are
						rejected by the network, preventing fraud.”</p>
				</div>

				<p>The Verisium Product Authentication Blockchain is statistically impossible to compromise, meaning that the
					amount of effort required to create a breach in the chain is extremely large relative to the result one might
					gain. If someone really, really, really wanted to fake a product in the Verisium blockchain, with enough
					computing power it might be done. However, the cost of that computing power is arbitrarily large (this means
					more than anyone might be able to afford!) and so the possibility of compromising the database is virtually
					zero.</p>
				<p>This means we can very confidently say that our product will always catch counterfeits.</p>



				<h3>Myth 3: There is only one blockchain.</h3>
				<p>There are many different technologies that go by the name Blockchain. They come in public and private
					versions, open and closed source, general purpose and tailored to specific solutions.</p>

				<h3>Myth 4: The blockchain can be used for anything and everything.</h3>
				<p>Though the code is powerful, it's not magical. Remember the days when fax machines first came into use?
					People talked about faxing pizzas along with everything else under the sun. But of course, this was just
					exuberance over a particularly interesting, revolutionary, but short-lived, piece of technology.</p>
				<p>Bitcoin and blockchain developers can be evangelical, and it's easy to understand why. For many, the
					blockchain is an authority tied to mathematics, not the government or lawyers. In the minds of some
					developers, the blockchain and <b>smart contracts</b> will one day replace money, lawyers, and other
					arbitration
					bodies. Yet the code is limited to the number of cryptocurrency transactions in the chain itself, and
					cryptocurrency is still far from mainstream.</p>
				<p>For us at Verisium, we are not concerned about the use of blockchain technology to create money at all. We
					use it as an immutable ledger to authenticate products. However, along with product authentication, we can
					also attach other very interesting and dynamic value-added services for the benefits of both customers and
					the brand-name manufacturers who serve them.</p>

				<h3>Myth 5: The blockchain ledger is locked and irrevocable.</h3>
				<p>Analogous large-scale transaction databases like bank records are, by their nature, private and tied to
					specific financial institutions. The power of blockchain, of course, is that the code is public, transactions
					are verifiable, and the network is cryptographically secure. Fraudulent transactions—double spends, in
					industry parlance—are rejected by the network, preventing fraud.</p>
				<p>This is feature that we at Verisium make use of - the ability of the blockchain to reject "double spends" or
					in our world, "dual/multiple instances of the same product" a.k.a. counterfeits.)</p>
				<p>The bust for this myth focused its attention on Bitcoin, saying, "because mining the chain provides a
					financial incentive in the form of Bitcoin, it is largely believed that rewriting historic transactions is
					not in the financial interest of participants. For now, however, as computational resources improve with
					time, so too does the potential for deception. The impact of future processing power on the integrity of the
					contemporary Blockchain remains unclear."</p>
				<p>This speaks to the matter of faking money, and this is an honest assessment. Is it possible to fake?
					Theoretically, yes, of course, as no computer system has perfect security. However, the chances against
					succeeding at this are statistically large and the amount of computer power required to compromise a
					blockchain is also statistically large. Since the advent of blockchain technology, further developments in
					managing both the speed and security of the digital ledger have taken place, with the result remaining that
					the blockchain is an extremely secure means of product verification.</p>


				<h3>Myth 6: Blockchain records can never be hacked or altered.</h3>
				<p>One of the main selling points about blockchains is their inherent permanence and transparency. When people
					hear that, they often think that means that blockchains are invulnerable to outside attacks. No system or
					database will ever be completely secure, but the larger and more distributed the network, the more secure it
					is believed to be. What blockchains can provide to applications that are developed on top of them is a way of
					catching unauthorized changes to records.</p>


				<h3>Myth 7: Blockchain can only be used in the financial sector.</h3>
				<p>The busting of this myth in the original text focused on the financial sector. However, we can state it more
					clearly: We are not using the blockchain for financial sector associated applications. We are using it for
					product authentication and aftermarket special services. It is that simple.</p>


				<h3>Myth 8: Blockchain is Bitcoin.</h3>
				<p>Since <b>Bitcoin</b> is more famous than the underlying technology, blockchain, many people get confused
					between
					the two. Blockchain is a technology that allows peerto-peer transactions to be recorded on a distributed
					ledger across the network. These transactions are stored in blocks and each block is linked to the previous
					one, therefore creating a chain. Thus, each block contains a complete and time-stamped record of all the
					transactions that occurred in the network. On the blockchain, everything is transparent and permanent. No one
					can change or remove a transaction from the ledger.</p>
				<p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that makes electronic payment possible directly between two people without going
					through a third party like a bank. Bitcoins are created and stored in a virtual wallet. Since there are no
					intermediaries between the two parties, no one can control the cryptocurrency. Hence, the number of bitcoins
					that will ever be released is limited and defined by a mathematical algorithm. </p>


				<h3>Myth 9: Blockchain is designed for Business interactions only.</h3>
				<p>Experts in blockchain are convinced that this technology will change the world and the global economy just
					like dot-coms did in the early 90’s. Hence, it is not only open to <a href="">big corporations;</a> it is
					accessible to
					everyone everywhere. If all it takes is an Internet connection to use the blockchain, one can easily imagine
					how many people worldwide will be able to interact with each other. </p>
